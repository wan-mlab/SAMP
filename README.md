# SAMP
SAMP: a <b>S</b>plit amino acid composition based AntiMicrobial Prediction model

SAMP is an ensemble random projection (RP) based computational model that leverages a new type of features called proportionalized split amino acid composition (PSAAC) in addition to conventional sequence-based features for AMP prediction. The tool also incorporates the ensemble RP architecture in our model, so that our model SAMP is scalable to processing large scale AMP screening.
